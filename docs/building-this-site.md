title: Building This Site
---

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install mkdocs-material

cd ~/Sites
mkdir mk-test
cd mk-test
mkdocs new .

```

Add to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  name: material
```

## Git Stuff

```bash
# in the mk-test4 directory
git init
touch .gitignore
echo ".DS_Store" >> .gitignore
echo ".gitignore" >> .gitignore
git status
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

Go to GitHub and create a new repository `mk-test4`.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/dgoppenheimer/mk-test4.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Publishing the Site

From [Publishing your site](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/publishing-your-site/)

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

```yaml
name: ci 
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master 
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.x
      - run: pip install mkdocs-material 
      - run: mkdocs gh-deploy --force
```

Go to GitHub &#8594; Settings &#8594; Pages &#8594; Source and choose `gh-pages` branch, and click `Save`.

!!! success

    So far, so good. I'll start changing a few things and see when the site breaks.

## Customize the Site

See the following pages for tips:

- [How do I specify custom primary color for mkdocs-material?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63017898/how-do-i-specify-custom-primary-color-for-mkdocs-material)  
- [Changing the colors](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/changing-the-colors/)  
- [Customization](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/)

Add the following to `mkdocs.yml`.

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
  - pymdownx.details
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

- Create the `docs/overrides/assets/images` directories, and add the favicon and logo images:

```bash
docs/overrides/assets/images/favicon.png
docs/overrides/assets/logo.svg
docs/overrides/favicon.ico
```

Add the following to `mkdocs.yml` to tell mkdocs where to find theme overrides:

```yaml
theme:
  custom_dir: material
  logo: assets/logo.svg
  favicon: assets/images/favicon.png
```

!!! success

    The site builds and deploys fine on GitHub.

!!! info

    I think the failure of the previous site to deploy to GitHub has to do with my changes to `index.html` or one of the partials when I created my landing page.

### Navigation Features

See [Setting up navigation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/setting-up-navigation/) in the Material theme documentation for excellent instructions.

Add the following to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  features:
    - navigation.tracking
    - navigation.tabs
    - navigation.tabs.sticky
    - navigation.top
```

### Footnotes

Add the following to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
markdown_extensions:
  - footnotes
```

### Change Colors on the Landing Page

The lower purple is okay, but I want to see how it looks with a lighter blue on top.

Add this to `mkdocs.yml`:

```yaml
theme:
  palette:
    primary: blue
```

Okay, I got most of the home page stuff shown on [Binbash Leverageâ„¢ Documentation](https://leverage.binbash.com.ar/), following their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/binbashar/le-ref-architecture-doc/) structure.

To the `/docs/index.md` file add the following at the top of the files:

```md
---
title: Molecular Dynamics
template: overrides/home.html
---
```
