As I started developing my course, *Practical Molecular Dynamics*, I quickly found I was collecting a
mountain of notes on preparing and analyzing simulations, and on the wide variety of software tools available for carrying out the simulations and analyses. Since I was taking my notes using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), I knew that organizing my notes as a website was the best way to go. I previously built a [notes site](https://dgoppenheimer.github.io/pymol-notes/) using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Hugo Learn](https://learn.netlify.app/en/) documentation theme, and it worked pretty well. This time I wanted something a bit different so I looked at other Hugo documentation themes, but didn't find anything that suited my needs. The [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) theme was close, but not quite right.

After looking at a few different static site generators, I eventually chose [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme for this site. MkDocs has all the features I want, and the Material theme is good looking, functional, and flexible.
